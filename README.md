Parallel C++ code for neutrino halo problem.

## Neutrino Halo Problem

The first paper about this problem is

Cherry, J. F., Carlson, J., Friedland, A., Fuller, G. M., & Vlasenko, A. (2012). Neutrino scattering and flavor transformation in supernovae. Physical Review Letters, 108(June), 1â€“5. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.261104

The essense of the problem is that neutrinos might be scattered back and interfere with the oscillations on it's earlier path. Thus the neutrino oscillation problem becomes a Nonlocal Boundary Value Problem. Analytically the problem is very hard to solve. However, with numerical methods, it's somehow trivial.

This repositary provides an parallel (with OpenMP) algorithm to solve the neutrino halo problem. It might be a reference to those who are working on other Nonlocal Boundary Value Problems.

Huaiyu Duan, my advisor, helped me a lot on C++ coding. Joshua Martin discussed and tested many of the interesting bugs and C++ facts.
